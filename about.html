    <p> Rubik's Cube is a 3-D combination puzzle invented in 1974 by Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture Ern≈ë Rubik. 
Originally called the Magic Cube, the puzzle was licensed by Rubik to be sold by Ideal Toy Corp in 1980 via businessman 
     Tibor Laczi and Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer.</p>
    <ol> Other names: Magic Cube, Speed Cube, Puzzle Cube, </ol>
    <ol> Inventor: Erno Rubik </ol>
    <ol> Year of invention: 1947 </ol>
    <ol> Company: Rubik's Brand Ltd </ol>
    <ol> Country: Hungary </ol>
<p> On the original classic Rubik's Cube, each of the six faces was covered by nine stickers, each of one of six solid colours:
  white, red, blue, orange, green, and yellow.
  Some later versions of the cube have been updated to use coloured plastic panels instead, which prevents peeling and fading.
  White is opposite yellow, blue is opposite green, and orange is opposite red, and the red, white, 
  and blue are arranged in that order in a clockwise arrangement. On early cubes, the position of the colours varied from cube to cube.</p>
    
    <p> Although the Rubik's Cube reached its height of mainstream popularity in the 1980s, it is still widely known and used.
   Many speedcubers continue to practice it and similar puzzles; they also compete for the fastest times in various categories.
   Since 2003, the World Cube Association,the Rubik's Cube's international governing body, 
   has organised competitions worldwide and recognises world records. </p>
